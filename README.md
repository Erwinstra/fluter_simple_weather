# simple_weather_app

This is a simple Flutter weather app that provides current weather information based on the user's location. The app uses the http package for making API requests, geolocator for fetching the user's geolocation, geocoding for converting geolocation into a human-readable address, and lottie for displaying animated weather icons.
